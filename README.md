# Holiday-Postcard-Generator
A simple cross-platform desktop application built using the Xojo framework to quickly generate print-ready 4" x 6" PDF holiday postcards from a user-selected image and custom message.

## 🛠️ Prerequisites

## 🚀 Usage
The application provides a straightforward interface:
